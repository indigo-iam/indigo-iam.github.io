This allows to use the same profile across all clients in an organization.\nIt’s also possible to define the profile to be used at client level, using scopes, i.e. adding among the scope allowed for the client the name of the profile the client should use. The scope, in this context, does not identify a set of permissions but an encoding of authentication/authorization informations in tokens and responses issued by IAM.\nThis mechanism enables integration of the same IAM instance with resources relying on different profiles.\nIAM currently supports four JWT profiles:\nthe iam profile the wlcg WLCG profile the aarc profile the kc profile Setting the default profile The IAM JWT default profile is set using the IAM_JWT_DEFAULT_PROFILE environment variable, e.g.:\nIAM_JWT_DEFAULT_PROFILE=iam The default profile will be used for all clients that do not explicitly and correctly request the use of a profile using scopes.\nUsing scopes to select the JWT profile for a client To select the profile used by a client, include one of the following scopes in the list of scopes authorized for a client:\niam, for the IAM profile wlcg, for the WLCG profile aarc, for the AARC profile kc, for the Keycloak profile Clients should only link to one profile. When multiple profiles are linked to a client, IAM falls back to the default profile configured for the IAM instance.\nUsing system scopes to control profile selection MitreID System Scopes can be used to control access to profile selection.\nThe scopes iam, wlcg and aarc used to select the JWT profile are not available in IAM by default; an administrator has to add all of them manually, as described in the in System Scopes documentation.\nSupported JWT profiles The IAM profile This is the default profile for IAM.\nWith this profile:\ngroups are encoded in the groups claim; all the groups the user is member of are included in the groups claim;\nauthentication information (username, email, groups) is not by default included in access tokens; this behaviour can be changed by setting the IAM_ACCESS_TOKEN_INCLUDE_AUTHN_INFO=true environment variable;\nscope information is not by default included in access tokens; this behaviour can be changed by setting the IAM_ACCESS_TOKEN_INCLUDE_SCOPE=true environment variable;\nthe nbf (not before) claim is not set in access tokens; this behaviour can be changed by setting the IAM_ACCESS_TOKEN_INCLUDE_NBF=true environment variable.\nThis profile is assigned to clients using the iam scope.\nThe WLCG profile This profile implements the Common JWT Token profile.\nIn particular:\nthe scope claim is always included in access tokens; groups are not included by default in access and ID tokens. This profile is assigned to clients using the wlcg scope.\nWith this profile:\ngroups are encoded in the wlcg.groups claim; all the non-optional groups the user is member of are included in the wlcg.groups claim;\nauthentication information (name, preferred username and email) is not by default included in access tokens; this behaviour can be changed by setting the IAM_ACCESS_TOKEN_INCLUDE_AUTHN_INFO=true environment variable and by requesting\nemail scope to include the email claim in access tokens; profile scope to include the name and preferred_username claims in access tokens; the nbf (not before) claim is not set in access tokens; this behaviour can be changed by setting the IAM_ACCESS_TOKEN_INCLUDE_NBF=true environment variable.\nRequesting groups with the WLCG profile When the WLCG profile is used, groups are not automatically included in access tokens and ID tokens, but can be requested using the wlcg.groups scope (which has to be added among the System Scopes), following the rules described in the WLCG profile.\nOptional groups Optional groups are groups whose membership is only asserted in tokens on explicit request coming from a user.\nIn order to configure a IAM group as an optional group, add the wlcg.optional-group label to the group.\nThe AARC profile This profile encodes group membership information following the rules defined by the AARC G002 profile document.\nIn particular:\ngroups and organisation name are not included by default in access and ID tokens; organisation name can be requested using the eduperson_scoped_affiliation scope and it’s encoded in the eduperson_scoped_affiliation claim; groups can be requested using the eduperson_entitlement scope and they’re encoded as URN in the eduperson_entitlement claim. All the mapping rules are described in the White Paper for implementation mappings between SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect in Research and Education.\nMoreover, the unique identifier voPersonID claim is available through this profile and follows the rules defined by the AARC G026 and the voPerson v2.0 schema version.\nvoPersonID is the community unique identifier and it holds the same value as the accountID given by INDIGO IAM. This claim is currently present within the following places (given the AARC profile is enabled):\nID Token Access Token Userinfo Response Introspection Response An example of an Access Token (produced via the Test client) is the following:\n{ \"sub\": \"73f16d93-2441-4a50-88ff-85360d78c6b5\", \"voperson_id\": \"73f16d93-2441-4a50-88ff-85360d78c6b5\", \"iss\": \"http://localhost:8080\", \"exp\": 1752744217, \"iat\": 1752740617, \"jti\": \"b13a5593-2bfc-42c6-9216-9b0a280905a9\", \"client_id\": \"client\" } From the example, one can see that the value from the sub and the voperson_id claim is identical.\nThis profile is assigned to clients using the aarc scope.\nThe Keycloak profile This profile allows the integration with a Keycloak environment.\nWith this profile:\nthe scope claim is always included in access tokens; groups are always included in access and ID tokens; they are encoded in the roles claim. Having roles claim instead of groups allows integration with the OIDC client - a conteinerised MISP deployment - which requires them to map IAM users.\nThis profile is assigned to clients using the kc scope.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Starting with version 1.6.0, IAM introduces support for JWT profiles. …","ref":"/v/v1.12.0/docs/reference/configuration/jwt-profiles/","tags":"","title":"JWT profiles support"},{"body":"To enhance account security and align with modern security standards, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has been introduced in the INDIGO IAM service.\nMFA allows users to add an additional layer of security by registering a second authentication factor.

This can be done issuing the following command:\n$ eval $(oidc-agent) Agent pid 62088 Registering a client In order to obtain a token out of IAM, a user needs a client registered. oidc-agent can automate this step and store client credentials securely on the user machine. This is a one-time operation, you do not need a new client every time you need a token.\nA new client can be registered using the oidc-gen command, as follows:\n$ oidc-gen -w device wlcg The -w device instructs oidc-agent to use the device code flow for the authentication, which is the recommended way with IAM.\noidc-agent will display a list of different providers that can be used for registration:\n[1] https://wlcg.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/ [2] https://iam-test.indigo-datacloud.eu/ ... [20] https://oidc.scc.kit.edu/auth/realms/kit/ Select one of the registered providers, or type a custom issuer (for IAM, the last character of the issuer string is always a /, e.g. https://wlcg.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/).\nThen oidc-agent asks for the scopes, typing max (without quotes) allows to get all the allowed scopes.\noidc-agent will register a new client and store the client credentials and a refresh token locally in encrypted form (the agent will ask for a password from the user).\nAs mentioned, oidc-gen is meant to be used only once, when you need a client registered.\nManaging oidc-agent account configurations To see the list of locally configured accounts use the following command:\n\u003e oidc-add -l The following account configurations are usable: DEEP-ac XDC atlas ... cms-voms-importer escape escape-monitoring iam-test infn-cloud wlcg You can then load an account in the agent again with the oidc-add command, as follows:\noidc-add wlcg Once you’ve loaded the account, you can use oidc-token to get tokens for that account.\nGetting tokens with oidc-token Tokens can be obtained using the oidc-token command, as follows:\noidc-token wlcg This will request a token with all the scopes requested at client registration time. To limit the scopes included in the token, the -s flag can be used, as follows:\noidc-token -s storage.read:/ wlcg The token audience can be limited using the --aud flag,\noidc-token --aud example.audience -s storage.read:/ wlcg Accessing oidc-agent client configuration Often is useful to get details about the client configuration generated by oidc-agent.

This is convenient since:\nit does not require any authorization from administrators (the device code flow can be requested by the user at client registration time) it allows the user to authenticate with any of the authentication mechanisms supported by the IAM it does not expose the user credentials to the client application For nitty and gritty details on how the flow works, see the RFC.\nAfter having registered a client with the device flow enabled (see client registration section), the device code flow can be used to obtain a token using a script like the one here which does the following:\ncontacts the device flow endpoint to start a device flow authentication and authorization prints code information on the terminal waits for user input to proceed and obtain the token(s) ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"A token can be obtained from a command-line interface (CLI) in two …","ref":"/v/v1.12.0/docs/tasks/user/getting-a-token/","tags":"","title":"Obtaining an IAM access token from a CLI"},{"body":"IAM supports brokered OpenID Connect authentication to external identity providers (e.g., Google).\nWhen brokered OpenID Connect authentication is turned on a IAM instance, users can log into the service delegating authentication to one of the supported OpenID Connect providers (OP).\nTo enable brokered OpenID Connect authentication on your IAM instance you have to:\nObtain client credentials and other configuration details for each of the external OpenID Connect providers; Provide the OIDC configuration file defining the configuration of the supported OPs; Enable the oidc profile.

In the Groups section, click on the Add to group button:\nChoose one or more groups and confirm the operation:\nStarting with version 1.7.0, when a user is added as member of the child group A/B, IAM takes care of adding them also to the parent group A that they are not already a members of.

When SAML authentication is turned on for an IAM instance, users can log into the service using the home Identity Provider (IdP) credentials.\nTo enable SAML authentication for your IAM instance you have to:\nChoose an entityId for your IAM instance; see the Shibboleth docs for guidance on this Generate a self-signed certificate for your IAM instance that will be used for SAML cryptographic operations and include it in a Java keystore; Obtain SAML metadata from your IdP or identity federation; If the metadata is signed, import the certificate that must be used to verify the signature in the Java keystore generated above; Enable the saml profile for the IAM and configure SAML support via the appropriate environment variables. Generate a Self-signed certificate To generate a self-signed certificate that lasts 5 years use the following openssl command:\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -x509 -days 1825 -keyout self-signed.key.pem \\ -out self-signed.cert.pem The above command will generate a private key and the corresponding certificate in PEM format. You will be asked to provide a subject for the certificate being generated.\nTo import this certificate in a Java keystore we need in in p12 format. Use the following commands to convert the certificate in p12 format and import it in a Java keystore:\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -inkey self-signed.key.pem \\ -name self-signed \\ -in self-signed.cert.pem \\ -out self-signed.p12 keytool -importkeystore -destkeystore self-signed.jks \\ -srckeystore self-signed.p12 \\ -srcstoretype PKCS12 During the above process you will be asked to provide a p12 export password and a keystore password. Use the same password, at least 6 characters long, otherwise it will not work for the java keystore.\nYou can list the contents of the keystore with the following command:\nkeytool -list -keystore self-signed.jks Obtain SAML metadata for your IdP or identity federation You IdP or identity federation will have a SAML metadata document describing, in SAML terms, which authentication flows are enabled and providing access to cryptographic material and other information that make the federated authentication schemes work reliably and securely. For more information on SAML metadata, see the Shibboleth metadata documentation.\nSigned metadata advice Typically identity federations sign the SAML metadata for security reasons, and provide a certificate (and linked public key) that can be used to verify signatures on the metadata at a well-known location (e.g., the federation website).\nTo support metadata signature verification you will need to import this certificate in the Java keystore created above.\nCertificates are typically published in PEM format, while to import a certificate in a Java keystore you will need it in DER format.\nThe following commands show how to import a PEM certificate into a Java keystore:\nopenssl x509 -outform der -in idem_signer_2019.pem -out idem_signer_2019.der keytool -import -alias idem_signer_2019 -keystore self-signed.jks -file idem_signer_2019.der Metadata configuration The IdP or federation metadata to be trusted can be specified with the IAM_SAML_IDP_METADATA environment variable, which contains an URL pointing to the metadata.\nIf the metadata is signed, you can enforce signature validation with the IAM_SAML_METADATA_REQUIRE_VALID_SIGNATURE variable.\nMetadata needs to be periodically refreshed to learn about new entities in the federation or updated key material. The metadata refresh interval can be specified with the IAM_SAML_METADATA_LOOKUP_SERVICE_REFRESH_PERIOD_SEC environment variable, which defines a refresh period in seconds (a reasonable value is typically refresh metadata every hour).\nAn example metadata configuration could be:\nIAM_SAML_IDP_METADATA=http://www.garr.it/idem-metadata/idem-metadata-sha256.xml IAM_SAML_METADATA_REQUIRE_VALID_SIGNATURE=true IAM_SAML_METADATA_LOOKUP_SERVICE_REFRESH_PERIOD_SEC=3600 IAM SAML attribute requirements IAM requires that the IdP used for authentication releases a persistent identifier attribute that can be used to link the external identity to local IAM accounts. If the IdP does not release persistent identifier attributes, it cannot be integrated with the IAM.\nThe attribute used to link the external SAML account is configurable. In the default configuration, IAM uses the following attributes (in the given order):\nEduPersonUniqueId EduPersonTargetedId EduPersonPrincipalName The order of these can be changed with the IAM_SAML_ID_RESOLVERS environment variable, which accepts a list of aliases for the attributes to be searched.\nThe following tables maps attribute names to the aliases currently supported:\nSAML attribute Alias EduPersonUniqueId eduPersonUniqueId EduPersonTargetedId eduPersonTargetedId EduPersonPrincipalName eduPersonPrincipalName EduPersonOrcid eduPersonOrcid spidCode spidCode The default value for IAM_SAML_ID_RESOLVERS is:\nIAM_SAML_ID_RESOLVERS=eduPersonUniqueId,eduPersonTargetedId,eduPersonPrincipalName Checking SAML assertion and authentication freshness IAM provides the ability to set a maximum age for SAML assertion and authentication statements received from IdPs.\nThe IAM_SAML_MAX_ASSERTION_TIME allows to define an upper bound (in seconds) on the SAML assertion lifetime, so that assertions that exceed such limit are considered invalid.\nThe IAM_SAML_MAX_AUTHENTICATION_AGE allows to define an upper bound (in seconds) on the authentication age linked to SAML authentication statements, so that users are forced to reauthenticate when this limit is exceeded.\nLimiting authentication only to selected IdPs IAM provides the ability to define constraints on which IdPs will be allowed for authentication. This is useful when you want to limit which IdPs in a large federation (e.g., EduGAIN) will be trusted for authentication.\nCurrently three types of IdPs limiting are supported:\nentity id whitelist SIRTFI compliance Research and Scholarship compliance Limiting by entity id The IAM_SAML_IDP_ENTITY_ID_WHITELIST environment variable can be used to define a comma-separated whitelist of IdPs entity IDs that will be trusted for authentication.\nThe following example limits trusted IdPs to the INFN IdP:\nIAM_SAML_IDP_ENTITY_ID_WHITELIST=\"https://idp.infn.it/saml2/idp/metadata.php\" Limiting by SIRTFI compliance To limit authentication only to IdPs that are SIRFTI-compliant, set the the IAM_SAML_METADATA_REQUIRE_SIRTFI environment variable to true.\nJoining a SAML federation An Indigo IAM instance can join a SAML federation as a service provider (SP). To join a feaderation you need to follow the following steps:\nConfigure the saml profile in IAM Register the Indigo IAM instance into the federation, following the federation instructions (generally involves connecting to a registration portal to declare the SP) Wait for the federation metadata to be updated at the federation IdPs. This typically involves a 12h delay. Check if login in IAM works successfully through the federation: note that it will not work before the federation IdPs have updated their metadata. If the error persists after the delay, contact your federation or IdP support. When registering the Indigo IAM SP, there are a few critical parameters to supply:\nAssertion Consumer Service (ACS), consisting of 3 parameters: Binding: must be HTTP Post URL: it is the instance URL + /saml/SSO, e.g. https://iam.example.com/saml/SSO Index: should be set to 0 X509 SAML certificate: the generated self-signed certificate Other, generally optional, parameters include the requested attribute. It is a good practice to declare as mandatory one of the attribute listed in IAM_SAML_ID_RESOLVERS.\nCustomizing SAML login button text You can customize the SAML login button text shown in the IAM login page with the IAM_SAML_LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT environment variable.\nMinimal SAML configuration example IAM_SAML_ENTITY_ID=urn:example:iam-saml-example IAM_SAML_KEYSTORE=file:///self-signed.jks IAM_SAML_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=xxxxxx IAM_SAML_KEY_ID=self-signed IAM_SAML_KEY_PASSWORD=xxxxxx IAM_SAML_IDP_METADATA=http://www.garr.it/idem-metadata/idem-metadata-sha256.xml IAM_SAML_METADATA_REQUIRE_VALID_SIGNATURE=true IAM_SAML_METADATA_LOOKUP_SERVICE_REFRESH_PERIOD_SEC=3600 IAM_SAML_LOGIN_BUTTON_TEXT=\"Sign in with IDEM\" Custom SAML configuration The configuration based on environment variables relies on a configuration template that fits most use cases embedded in the IAM war file.\nTo have full control on the SAML configuration, provide a custom application-saml.yml file in the IAM configuration directory.\nSee the configuration reference for more SAML metadata options and instructions on how to override the default IAM configuration.\nRegistration form: filling information from IdP See registration configuration.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"IAM supports brokered SAML authentication.

The AUP is presented to applicants at registration time or periodically.\nManaging the AUP The AUP can be managed from the “AUP” section in the IAM dashboard, or via the AUP management API.\nAdministrator privileges are required.\nCreating the AUP By default, the AUP is not defined for an organization, i.e. it must be explicitly defined by an IAM administrator.\nThe AUP can be created by clicking on the “Create AUP” button in the AUP management page (that can be reached clicking the “AUP” link in the organization Management navigation bar):\nA dialog is shown:\nwhere the administrator can enter the AUP URL and define how frequently the AUP should be accepted by users.\nIf the AUP signature validity is set to 0, a signature on the AUP will be requested only once (either at registration time or at the first IAM login after the AUP creation). A zero value means basically that the AUP signature does not expire.\nA positive value in the AUP signature validity means, on the other hand, that the signature will expire after that number of days. As an example, an administrator that wants the AUP to signed each year by users should put 365 in the “AUP signature validity” field.\nSince version 1.10.0, a new cron task has been added that runs every four hours to check the expiration status of each user’s AUP (Acceptable Usage Policy) signature. If a signature has expired or is about to expire, an email notification is sent to the relevant user.\nAdministrators can configure AUP reminders, which notify users of the remaining days until their AUP expires. These reminders can be set up directly from the dashboard. If the AUP signature validity is set to 0, AUP reminders will not be displayed. If the AUP signature validity is set to a value greater than 0, the AUP reminders will become mandatory.\nSuccessful AUP creation criteria Valid AUP URL The AUP URL must be a properly formatted, valid URL AUP signature validity The signature validity period (in days) must be an integer value greater than or equal to 0 AUP reminders The reminder period(s) (in days) must be one or more numbers, separated by commas if multiple, that satisfy the following conditions: Each reminder must be greater than 0 Each reminder must be less than the AUP signature validity period Based on the screenshot above, the user will receive three AUP signature reminder emails at 30 days, 15 days, and 1 day prior to the expiration date. Additionally, one AUP expiration email will be sent one year after the AUP is signed.\nEditing and deleting the AUP The AUP can be edited and deleted from the AUP management page:\nSince version 1.6.0, the AUP has been converted from text to a URL.

In fact, when users apply for membership in an organization, administrators are asked to validate membership requests.\nRegistration with external IdP When an external OIDC or SAML IdP is used to authenticate users, IAM allows to configure:\nWhether users are required to authenticate through an external IdP and optionally which ones Which information must be retrieved from the IdP to fill the account creation form This is done by creating a YAML file in /indigo-iam/config, for example /indigo-iam/config/application-registration.yaml. When deploying IAM with a container, a volume providing this file must be mapped into the container.\nThe contents in this file must be under the following hierarchy:\niam: registration: Requiring external authentication To require that users must authenticate through an external IdP, you need to set the parameter require-external-authentication=true. You can also specify the type of external IdP (oidc or saml) and require one specific issuer.\nThe following fragment is an example of authentication with the (OIDC-based) CERN SSO required before being redirected to the registration page. It also defines how information from identity tokens issued by CERN SSO is mapped to IAM membership information\niam: registration: require-external-authentication: true oidc-issuer: https://auth.cern.ch/auth/realms/cern authentication-type: oidc Filling information from IdP The first time a user authenticates in an IAM instance, the account creation form will be displayed. It is possible to request that some of the fields are filled with the value of an IdP attribute and to define that some of these fields are read-only, i.e. that the value provided by the IdP cannot be changed.\nTo enable filling the creation form with values provided by the IdP, you need to create a YAML file in /indigo-iam/config, for example /indigo-iam/config/application-registration.yaml. The contents should be something similar to:\niam: registration: fields: email: read-only: false external-auth-attribute: email name: read-only: false external-auth-attribute: given_name surname: read-only: false external-auth-attribute: family_name username: read-only: false external-auth-attribute: preferred_username read-only can be set to true if you want to prevent that the value provided supplied by the ID is modified by the user. Note that if a field is defined as read-only=true and now value is not provided by the IdP, it may result that the user cannot submit the account creation form if the field, when it is required.\nexternal-auth-attribue must be the name of the IdP attribute, or token claim (when provided by SAML IdPs, or OIDC Providers, respectively) to use for the mentioned account creation form field.\nAutomatic enrollment through SAML IdPs In case of registration through an external SAML Identity Provider, IAM offers a flexible user enrollment flow, also without IAM admin intervention. The default IAM behavior is that the user enrollment requires an administrator approval step.\nIn order to enable the automatic enrollment flow via an external IdP, one should set the following properties, under the saml hierarchy:\nsaml: jit-account-provisioning: enabled: true # this will consider as trusted all the IdPs declared in your # application-saml.yml file trusted-idps: all In order to directly declare the list of trusted SAML IdPs, a comma separated list of entity IDs have to be set, e.g. saml.jit-account-provisioning.trusted-idps=idp1,idp2,idp3.\nUser editable fields Starting with version 1.6.0, IAM allows to limit which fields of the user profile are editable by users.\nThe default, backward-compatible settings that allow users to edit all their profile fields are defined as follows:\niam: user-profile: editable-fields: - email - name - picture - surname To prevent modifications to any of the fields remove the field name from editable-fields list.\nExternal configuration can be managed by placing directives as shown above in a custom configuration file\nAutomatically set the nickname as attribute Since IAM v1.9.0, during a registration request the username can be automatically added as an attribute named nickname. This process happens both for login with external provider, or when one directly clicks on the Apply for an account button. The nickname value will be the same as the username set during the registration request.\nThis behavior does not appear by default. To enable it, add to your config file\niam: registration: add-nickname-as-attribute: true or set the environment variable IAM_ADD_NICKNAME_AS_ATTRIBUTE=true.\nOnce the new IAM user has been created, the Attributes view from the dashboard looks like the following\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"IAM implements a basic registration service that requires the …","ref":"/v/v1.12.0/docs/reference/configuration/registration/","tags":"","title":"Registration \u0026 Enrollment"},{"body":"IAM already supports a set of SCIM APIs based on the System for Cross-domain Identity Management standard.

This means in practice that IAM can act both as an OAuth/OpenID Connect authorization server and as a VOMS server for a given organization. TLS termination and client VOMS atttribute certificate parsing and validation is delegated to an NGINX VOMS module, which can de deployed as a sidecar service that just protects the VOMS AA or also in front of the IAM backend application. The two scenarios are depicted above.\nIn order to deploy a VOMS attribute authority, you are recommended to use the following docker images:\ncnafsd/nginx-httpg-voms, for a NGINX server configured with the VOMS module, which replaces OpenResty VOMS indigoiam/voms-aa-bp:v1.12.0, for the VOMS AA service Deployment from packages is not currently supported for the VOMS attribute authority.\nNGINX VOMS module configuration The NGINX VOMS module requires:\nthe IGTF trust anchors properly configured; see the EGI trust anchors container. The certificate and private key to use: the certificate issuer must be one of the CA present in the EGI trust anchors. See the specific section below. the vomsdir folder, with the VOMS LSC configuration generated starting from the VOMS attribute authority X.509 credential. To generate the LSC configuration, you need to get the subject and issuer of the VOMS AA X.509 credential and put them in a file named as the fully qualified domain name of the VOMS attribute authority with the .lsc extension.\nLet’s assume that the IAM VOMS AA will answer on voms.test.example for the VO example.vo. The following command will generate the appropriate LSC file (X509_VOMS_DIR can be set to any directory where you have writing privileges):\n\u003e mkdir -p ${X509_VOMS_DIR}/example.vo \u003e openssl x509 -in voms_local_io.cert.pem -noout -subject -issuer -nameopt compat | \\ gsed -e 's/^subject=//' -e 's/^issuer=//' \u003e \\ ${X509_VOMS_DIR}/example.vo/voms.test.example.lsc For an example NGINX configuration, see the one use in VOMS-enabled NGINX container.\nVOMS AA configuration The VOMS AA is a Spring Boot application that shares the persistence layer implementation with IAM, and as such can inspect the IAM database. It can share the same environment file as the login service it is associated with, with the addition of the following variables:\nVOMS_AA_HOST: host name used to access the VOMS AA service VOMS_AA_PORT VOMS AA port VOMS_AA_VO: VO served by the VOMS AA service (lower case). A top level group equal to VOMS_AA_VO must be defined in IAM. The attributes appearing in the VOMS proxy include all the sub-groups of the parent group equal to the VO name. Top level groups different from the VO name may still be used for group-based authorization with JWTs, but will not appear in the proxy.\nYou also need to create a VOMS AA YAML configuration file with the content below (its content should be generic as it relies on standard environment variables used to configure the login service) and map it to the container as /workspace/config/application.yml.\nserver: address: 0.0.0.0 port: 8080 use-forward-headers: true max-http-header-size: 16000 spring: main: banner-mode: \"off\" jpa: open-in-view: true datasource: dataSourceClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource url: jdbc:mysql://${IAM_DB_HOST}:${IAM_DB_PORT:3306}/${IAM_DB_NAME}?useLegacyDatetimeCode=false\u0026serverTimezone=UTC\u0026useSSL=false username: ${IAM_DB_USERNAME} password: ${IAM_DB_PASSWORD} max-active: ${IAM_DB_MAX_ACTIVE:10} max-idle: ${IAM_DB_MAX_IDLE:5} initial-size: ${IAM_DB_INITIAL_SIZE:1} test-while-idle: ${IAM_DB_TEST_WHILE_IDLE:true} test-on-borrow: ${IAM_DB_TEST_ON_BORROW:true} validation-query: ${IAM_DB_VALIDATION_QUERY:SELECT 1} time-between-eviction-runs-millis: ${IAM_DB_TIME_BETWEEN_EVICTION_RUNS_MILLIS:5000} min-evictable-idle-time-millis: ${IAM_DB_MIN_EVICTABLE_IDLE_TIME_MILLIS:60000} flyway: enabled: false voms: tls: certificate-path: /certs/hostcert.pem private-key-path: /certs/hostkey.pem trust-anchors-dir: /etc/grid-security/certificates trust-anchors-refresh-interval-secs: 14400 aa: host: ${VOMS_AA_HOST:undefined} port: ${VOMS_AA_PORT:undefined} vo-name: ${VOMS_AA_VO:undefined} use-legacy-fqan-encoding: ${VOMS_AA_USE_LEGACY_FQAN_ENCODING:true} To map this file (in the example below, voms-aa.ymlas /workspace/config/application.yml), you typically need to add the following volume definition to the VOMS AA section of your Podman/Docker compose file:\nvolumes: - /path/to/voms-aa.yml:/workspace/config/application.yml:ro,Z Note: Z at the end of the line is required only if you use SELinux\nIn addition, you need to configure the EGI trust anchors and the VOMS AA certificate and private key, as described below.\nConfiguration of EGI trust anchors and VOMS AA certificate Both the VOMS-enabled NGINX service and the VOMS AA service require the proper configuration of the container, the certificate and private key to use and the EGI trust anchors. If using Podman/Docker Compose, it is typically done with:\nvolumes: - /path/to/certs/voms.test.example.cert.pem:/certs/hostcert.pem:ro,Z - /path/to/certs/voms.test.example.cert.key:/certs/hostkey.pem:ro,Z - /etc/grid-security/certificates:/etc/grid-security/certificates:ro,Z The line to map EGI trust anchor may be different if you use EGI trust anchors container. See the Podman/Docker Compose example for more information.\nNote that the private key must be readable by the user running the service. As it is not a good practice to make it world readable, it may be necessary to adjust its ownership.\nPodman/Docker Compose example For an example of the container configurations, see the VOMS AA Docker compose file.\n","categories":"","description":"Instructions on how to deploy and configure the IAM VOMS attribute authority micro-service\n","excerpt":"Instructions on how to deploy and configure the IAM VOMS attribute …","ref":"/v/v1.12.0/docs/tasks/deployment/voms/","tags":"","title":"Deploying the IAM VOMS attribute authority"},{"body":"The VOMS importer script For VOs that already use VOMS to manage their organization, a script is available to synchronize one-way their VOMS instance with their IAM instance.\nThe VOMS information that is synchronized includes:\nVOMS Groups VOMS Roles VOMS Users Personal information X.509 certificates Group and role membership Generic attributes The script needs admininistrative privileges on both VOMS and IAM, represented respectively by a VOMS proxy and an IAM access token. As it synchronizes INDIGO IAM information with VOMS information (rather than overwriting it), it can be run multiple times to fix problems in previous runs.\nThe documentation on how to run the vomsimporter.py script is available at https://github.com/indigo-iam/voms-importer.\nMigration of groups and roles Both IAM and VOMS support the concepts of group and role.\nGroups are very similar in both contexts. They differ slightly in the representation: a VOMS group has the form /\u003cgroup\u003e/\u003csubgroup\u003e/..., whereas a IAM group has the form \u003cgroup\u003e/\u003csubgroup\u003e/..., i.e. there is no leading /.\nFor example, the VOMS group /atlas/production becomes the IAM group atlas/production.\nRoles differ in a more profound way: whereas a VOMS role is a distinct entity from a group, in IAM a role is simply a group with the specific labels wlcg.optional-group and voms.role. An optional group is included in an OAuth token or in a VOMS proxy only if requested.\nFor example, the VOMS group with role /atlas/Role=VO-Admin becomes the IAM optional group atlas/VO-Admin.\nGroups and roles are imported in IAM only if not already present there.\nGroups and roles can be created directly in IAM without any corresponding group or role in VOMS; those are not considered by the importer script.\nMigration of users Only active VOMS users are imported: nothing is done on the INDIGO IAM side for a user suspended in VOMS, except if you add option --synchronize-activation-status to force the synchronization of activation state in INDIGO IAM using the activation state in VOMS. Without this option, a user suspended in VOMS may still be active in IAM if the user was imported (and active) before it was suspended in VOMS.\nNote about CERN instances: since INDIGO IAM at CERN is also integrated with the CERN Human Resource (HR) database, the HR check will ensure that users are suspended/removed from the VO when experiment membership is no longer valid.\nWhen creating a IAM account for a newly-discovered VOMS user, the importer script generates a username of the form voms.\u003cvoms-id\u003e. There is an option to use the value of an attribute (e.g. nickname) from the user entry in VOMS, if available.\nThe script by default removes a user from groups (including roles) where they do not belong any more.\nCERN SSO automatic linking The importer script can be configured to automatically link the imported account to the CERN SSO identity in two ways:\nusing the nickname VOMS account generic attribute resolving the CERN username from the CERN LDAP Unique email address for users in IAM VOMS allows different users to share an email address. IAM instead requires that each user has a unique email address.\nThe import script implements an email override mechanism, that maps a VOMS user id to another email address; however, a better approach would be to clean up the VOMS database in order to avoid multiple accounts sharing email addresses.\nVOMS importer log The importer script produces an auditing log, detailing the actions applied to groups, roles and users.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The VOMS importer script For VOs that already use VOMS to manage their …","ref":"/v/v1.12.0/docs/tasks/deployment/voms_importer/","tags":"","title":"Importing VOMS information into IAM"},{"body":"The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v1.12.0.\nThis release provides bug fixes and enhancements, as can be seen in the release notes.\nThe major highlights include:\nintegration of MFA with external OIDC, SAML and x509 providers (experimental) skip the IAM MFA phase if the providers already authenticated through the second factor improve logging of VOMS-AA operations allow for PATCH operation to replace groups in SCIM endpoint support for resource parameter during an authorization request assign oidc-agent clients ownership to whom approved it add an IAM READER role that gives read access to users and groups info As usual, the IAM docker image can be obtained from DockerHub.\n","categories":"","description":"The v1.12.0 release includes the integration of MFA with external providers (experimentally)","excerpt":"The v1.12.0 release includes the integration of MFA with external …","ref":"/v/v1.12.0/blog/2025/05/30/iam-v1.12.0/","tags":"","title":"IAM v1.12.0"},{"body":"The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v1.11.0.\nThe main feature of this release is the possibility to enable the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) through a button in the user homepage.

It can be used to request an access token when a client wishes to utilize an existing trust relationship, expressed through the semantics of the JWT, without a direct user-approval step at the authorization server. Client authentication using a JWT is nothing more than an alternative way for a client to authenticate to the token endpoint and must be used in conjunction with some grant type to form a complete and meaningful protocol request, for instance the authorization code flow (when a user has to approve the client in order to access to their resources), the client credential flow (when a client is acting on its own behalf), etc.\nJWT assertion validation The IAM Authorization Server validates the JWT assertion and issues an access token if the following conditions are satisfied.\nJWT assertion header\nthe “alg” (algorithm) claim must be present to indicate the algorithm used to sign the token; the “kid” (key ID) claim must be present in the asymmetrically signed assertions to identify the public key. JWT assertion body\nthe “iss” (issuer) and “sub” (subject) claims must be equal to the client_id; the “aud” (audience) claim must be equal to the token endpoint URL; the “exp” (expiration) claim must be present to limit the JWT assertion lifetime; the “jti” (JWT ID) claim must be present and provides a unique identifier for the token. Client settings You need to configure an OAuth2 client in IAM which is used to issue a JWT assertion and get an access token.\nFollow the instruction on how to register a new client, or edit an existing client (click on the My clients link on the left navigation bar of the IAM dashboard and select the client name). From the Credentials tab you can choose the authentication method to the token endpoint:\nclient secret with symmetrically signed JWT assertion; asymmetrically signed JWT assertion. Symmetrically signed JWT assertion This authentication mechanism is used when your JWT assertion is signed with a symmetric key.\nTo use this mechanism, select Client secret with symmetrically signed JWT assertion; the Client secret generated by IAM must be used as symmetric key to sign your JWT assertion.\nA symmetrically signed JWT assertion looks like\n## Header { \"alg\": \"HS256\" } ## Payload { \"sub\": \"181f26f9-4562-4919-b718-759241485335\", \"aud\": \"https://iam.local.io/token\", \"nbf\": 1649162752, \"iss\": \"181f26f9-4562-4919-b718-759241485335\", \"exp\": 1651754752, \"iat\": 1649162752, \"jti\": \"120240aa-e389-4a55-8384-f4d7a54c2633\" } Asymmetrically signed JWT assertion This authentication mechanism is used when your JWT assertion is signed with a private key.\nTo use this mechanism, select Asymmetrically signed JWT assertion and then choose how IAM can get the public key used to validate your JWT assertion.

The Token Exchange OAuth specification defines “a lightweigth protocol that enables clients to request and obtain security tokens from authorization servers”.\nOAuth 2.0 was designed to solve the problem of a delegated access to resources across services, mediated by an authorization server, as shown in the following picture:\nOAuth delegation In the picture above we have the usual OAuth roles:\nThe user (or resource owner, in OAuth terminology); A resource server, ie. a service hosting user resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens. A client: this is an agent that has received a permission from the user to act on his behalf on his resources hosted on a resource server; An authorization server: a service that issues access token to clients after having authenticated the user and obtained an authorization from the user that the client is entitled to act on user’s resources There are scenarios when a resource server, in order to satisfy a client request, needs to access resources hosted by other downstream services on behalf of the user, like in the following picture:\nOAuth token exchange In OAuth, access tokens are bearer tokens, so the first resource server could simply use the access token received from the client to interact, on behalf of the user, with the downstream resource server.\nThere are, however, situations in which just using the received access token against the downstream service is not possible, like for instance if the token audience was scoped to be valid only on the first resource server.\nMoreover, the resource server could need the ability to act on behalf of the user for an unbounded amount of time (e.g., to implement long-running computations), not limited by the validity of the received access token.\nThe token exchange specification was designed to provide a protocol in support of these scenarios, where a client can exchange an access token received from antoher client with a new token (or a set of tokens, as we will see) by interacting with a trusted OAuth authorization server.\nImpersonation vs delegation As specified in the Token Exchange OAuth specification, when a subject A impersonates B, A has all the rights of B and it is indistinguishable from B. So, when A interacts within any other entity, A is B.\nWith delegation A still has its own identity, separate from B. So when A interacts within another entity, it is explicit that A is representing B, because B has delegated some of its rights to A.\nMore details about the difference from this two semantics can be found in this section of the specification.\nThe INDIGO IAM token exchange implementation currently supports only impersonation semantics.\nClient configuration requirements In order to request a token exchange, a client must be configured with the urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange grant type enabled. The token exchange grant type is disabled by default for dynamically registered clients, and can be enabled only by users with administrative privileges.\nThe token exchange request A client who wants to exchange an access token with a new one (or a couple of new tokens, in case a refresh token is requested), must send an authenticated request to the IAM /token endpoint, specifying the following properties:\nParameter Value grant_type urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange subject_token The subject access token that the client wants to exchange scope The set of scopes requested for the new access token audience Optional. A space-separated list of resource identifiers that will be used to limit the audience of the issued token Scopes in exchanged tokens A client, when requesting a token exchange, can request any of the scopes enabled by its client configuration. IAM system scopes are however handled in a special way. These scopes, in order to be “exchanged” across clients, need to be\nenabled for the client requesting the token exchange linked to the subject token presented for the token exchange The list of system scopes currently defined in the IAM can be obtained by registered users by issuing a request to the IAM system scopes API:\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer ...\" https://iam.example/api/scopes Token Exchange example This section describes a token exchange flow.\nWe start with a normal OAuth flow where a client, token-exchange-subject, requests an access token from the IAM using the resource owner password credential flow. The token-exchange-subject client is configured to use HTTP basic authentication against the IAM token endpoint, and in this example acts on behalf of the test user. We use the resource owner password credentials flow for convenience, but any other OAuth or OpenID connect flow that involves a user identity would be fine (i.e., authorization code).\n$ export IAM_TOKEN_ENDPOINT=https://iam.local.io/token $ export SUBJECT_ID=token-exchange-subject $ export SUBJECT_SECRET=... $ export USERNAME=test $ export PASSWORD=... $ curl -s -u $SUBJECT_ID:$SUBJECT_SECRET \\ -d username=$USERNAME \\ -d password=$PASSWORD \\ -d grant_type=password \\ -d scope=\"openid profile\" \\ $IAM_TOKEN_ENDPOINT | tee /tmp/response | jq Note that the only scopes requested in this first request are openid and profile, i.e. the scopes required to access user identity information.

Unfortunately the set of scopes linked to the access token received are not sufficient to do this, and so app decides to exchange the token received with another one granting enough privileges.\nIn Token Exchange terms, here app is the actor, the subject identity linked to the token is the test user, and the audience for the new token being requested would be the https://tasks.app.example.org/api API.\nSo app would do a request like the following:\n$ export ACTOR_ID=https://app.example.org/api $ export ACTOR_SECRET=... $ export AUDIENCE=https://tasks.example.org/api $ curl -s -u $ACTOR_ID:$ACTOR_SECRET \\ -d grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange \\ -d audience=$AUDIENCE \\ -d subject_token=$SUBJECT_TOKEN \\ # This token was received from the initial client -d scope=\"openid profile read-tasks\" \\ $IAM_TOKEN_ENDPOINT | tee /tmp/response | jq Note that app requests an additional scope, read-tasks, to interact with the downstream service.\nSince app is a trusted client for token exchange, the IAM responds with the following JSON:\n{ \"access_token\": \"eyJra...\", \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \"expires_in\": 3599, \"scope\": \"openid profile read-tasks\", \"issued_token_type\": \"urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt\" } And app can use the newly issued access token to invoke services on https://task-app.example.org/api on behalf of user test:\n$ curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer eyJra...\" http://tasks.example.org/api Trust Clients that have the token exchange grant enabled are considered trusted clients i.e., no explicit grant from the user is needed to grant access to client scopes. For IAM system scopes, however, these can be “exchanged” only if linked to the original subject token.\nLimitation and known issues The current implementation of Token Exchange in Indigo IAM has the following limitations:\nDelegation is not yet supported: if actor_token or the want_composite parameters are specified within the request, an error response is returned by the authorization server; The resource field is ignored.

Note that these scopes are restricted in the default IAM configuration, i.e. can be assigned to clients only by IAM administrators.\nExamples below assume OAuth authorization via bearer token: e.g.\nGET /Users/2819c223-7f76-453a-919d-413861904646 HTTP/1.1 Host: example.com Authorization: Bearer h480djs93hd8 The SCIM protocol specifies well known endpoints and HTTP methods for managing Resources defined in the SCIM core schema specification.\nIAM SCIM Endpoints IAM implements the following SCIM endpoints:\n/scim/Users, providing access to user account resources; /scim/Users/Bulk, providing access to bulk user operations in a single request; /scim/Groups, providing access to group resources; /scim/Me, providing access to the user account resource for the currently authenticated user. For the /scim/Users and /scim/Groups endpoints the following methods are implemented:\nHTTP Method Description GET Retrieves a complete or partial Resource. POST Create new Resource or bulk modify Resources. PUT Replace completely a Resource. PATCH Modifies a Resource with a set of specified changes (partial update). DELETE Deletes a Resource. For the /scim/Me endpoint, only the GET and PATCH methods are implemented.\nWarning For scalability reasons, IAM no longer returns the members claim for the SCIM Group resources, as the SCIM standard does not currently describe a way to implement pagination on group members.\nFor this reason, IAM provides two additional resources:\nthe members resource, which returns a paginated view of users belonging to a given group; the sugroups resource, which returns a paginated view of subgroups of a given group. Pagination IAM SCIM implementation supports pagination on the /scim/Users, /scim/Groups resources, as mandated by the standard, but also on the non-standard /scim/Groups/{id}/members and /scim/Groups/{id}/subgroups endpoints.\nPagination allows to “page through” large numbers of resources. Pagination is not session based so clients must never assume repeatable results.\nThe following table describes URL pagination parameters:\nParameter Description Default startIndex The 1-based index of the first search result. 1 count Non-negative Integer. Specifies the desired maximum number of search results per page; e.g., 10. None. The following table describes the query response pagination attributes:\nElement Description itemsPerPage Non-negative Integer. Specifies the number of search results returned in a query response page; e.g., 10. totalResults Non-negative Integer. Specifies the total number of results matching the client query; e.g., 1000. startIndex The 1-based index of the first result in the current set of search results; e.g., 1. The IAM SCIM resource schemas SCIM provides an extensible schema mechanism that allows to describe multiple resource types. Currently IAM supports two resource types:\nUsers Groups User resources The IAM SCIM user resource provides basic user information as mandated by the SCIM user schema (e.g., username, group membership, email addresses) as well as IAM specific information as defined by the urn:indigo-dc:scim:schemas:IndigoUser schema.\nClaim Description oidcIds A list of OpenID Connect accounts linked to

Attributes may be deleted, replaced, merged, or added in a single request. The body of a PATCH request MUST contain a partial resource with the desired modifications. The server MUST return either a 200 OK response code and the entire Resource within the response body, or a 204 No Content response code and the appropriate response headers for a successful PATCH request.\nThe following example shows how to replace the userName:\nPATCH http://localhost:8080/scim/Users/b6769dd1-3d7d-416d-be6d-020be23ba904 Body: { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp\" ], \"operations\": [ { \"op\": \"replace\", \"value\": { \"userName\": \"john_lennon_jr\", } } ] } The following example shows how to add an OpenID Connect account and a ssh key:\nPATCH http://localhost:8080/scim/Users/b6769dd1-3d7d-416d-be6d-020be23ba904 Body: { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp\" ], \"operations\": [ { \"op\": \"add\", \"value\": { \"urn:indigo-dc:scim:schemas:IndigoUser\": { \"oidcIds\": [ { \"issuer\": \"test_issuer\", \"subject\": \"test_subject\" } ], \"sshKeys\": [ { \"display\": \"Personal\", \"primary\": true, \"value\": \"AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC4tjz4mfMLvJsM8RXIgdRYPBhH//VXLXbeLbUsJpm5ARIQPY6Gu1befPA3jqKacvdcBrMsYGiMp/DOhpkAwWclSnzMdvYLbYWkrOPwBVrRh7lvFtXFLaQZ6do4uMZHb5zU2ViTFacrJ6zJ/GLltjk4nBea7Z4qHaQdWou3Fk/108oMQGx7jqW44m+TA+HYo6rEbVWbimWVXyyiKchO2LTLKUbK6GBSWJiItezwAWR3KKs3FXKRmbJDiKESh3mDccJidfkjzNLPyDf3JHI2b/C/mcvtJsoAtkIWuVll2BhBBiqkYt3tX2llZCYGtF7rZOYTsqhw+LPnsJtsX+W7e4iN\" } ] } } } ] } DELETE /scim/Users/{id} Requires scim:write scope.\nClients request user removal via DELETE.\nDELETE /scim/Users/4380e98c-02f2-4d10-85ba-9fbbdb819ed8 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Example: Client attempt to retrieve the previously deleted User:\nGET /scim/Users/4380e98c-02f2-4d10-85ba-9fbbdb819ed8 { \"status\": \"404\", \"detail\": \"No user mapped to id '4380e98c-02f2-4d10-85ba-9fbbdb819ed8'\", \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error\" ] } POST /scim/Users/Bulk Requires scim:write scope.\nThis endpoint allows consumers to execute multiple operations through one request, reducing network and processing overhead. Users may be created or updated in bulk using the POST and PATCH HTTP methods.\nThe body of this request MUST contain a list of operations where each operation includes a supported HTTP method (POST or PATCH only). The body of each operation MUST also contain a path attribute with the resource’s relative path to the SCIM service provider’s root and a data attribute with the resources required for a single POST or PATCH operation. POST operations MUST include a bulkId attribute to uniquely identify the new resource for cross-referencing within the same request.\nIf the request is successful, a 200 OK response code will be returned containing the result of all processed operations. Each operation response contains a status attribute that details the HTTP response status code of the requested operation. If the status of the operation response is not within the 200-series, it will also contain a response body. If the requested operation is successful, its response will include a location attribute with the resource’s endpoint. If the requested operation is unsuccessful, the response body will contain the details of the error.\nExample with two bulk operations: the first uses the POST method to create a user and the second uses the PATCH method to update user credentials.\nPOST http://localhost:8080/scim/Users/Bulk { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:BulkRequest\" ], \"operations\": [ { \"method\": \"POST\", \"path\": \"/Users\", \"bulkId\": \"qwerty\", \"data\": { \"id\": \"75ad58a5-1d1f-f77e-0f3e-4f9d5e45ae35\", \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User\" ], \"displayName\": \"Patrick Star\", \"name\": { \"givenName\": \"Patrick\", \"familyName\": \"Star\", \"middleName\": \"\" }, \"emails\": [ { \"type\": \"work\", \"value\": \"patrick@star.com\", \"primary\": true } ], \"userName\": \"partickstar\", \"active\": true, \"picture\": \"\" } }, { \"method\": \"PATCH\", \"path\": \"/Users/73f16d93-2441-4a50-88ff-85360d78c6b5\", \"data\": { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp\" ], \"operations\": [ { \"op\": \"add\", \"value\": { \"displayName\": \"Paul McCartney\", \"name\": { \"givenName\": \"Paul\", \"familyName\": \"McCartney\", \"middleName\": \"\" } } } ] } } ] } All operations are executed even if there are partial failures. In the example request, the POST operation is expected to fail as the user already exists. The returned response is:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/scim+json;charset=UTF-8 { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:BulkResponse\" ], \"operations\": [ { \"method\": \"POST\", \"status\": \"409\", \"bulkId\": \"qwerty\", \"errorResponse\": { \"status\": \"409\", \"detail\": \"A user with username 'partickstar' already exists\", \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error\" ] } }, { \"method\": \"PATCH\", \"status\": \"200\", \"location\": \"/Users/73f16d93-2441-4a50-88ff-85360d78c6b5\" } ] } The bulkId attribute, which is REQUIRED for all POST operations, MUST be unique within the request. It should not contain personally identifiable information as it may appear in logs or error messages. Resources created by a POST operation can be referenced in subsequent operations using the bulkId, with the prefix bulkId:, to update users that are being created in the same bulk request.\nAn example of a request where a user is created and later updated using the bulkId in the operation path /Users/bulkid:qwerty.\nPOST http://localhost:8080/scim/Users/Bulk { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:BulkRequest\" ], \"operations\": [ { \"method\": \"POST\", \"path\": \"/Users\", \"bulkId\": \"qwerty\", \"data\": { \"id\": \"75ad58a5-1d1f-f77e-0f3e-4f9d5e45ae35\", \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User\" ], \"displayName\": \"Patrick Star\", \"name\": { \"givenName\": \"Patrick\", \"familyName\": \"Star\", \"middleName\": \"\" }, \"emails\": [ { \"type\": \"work\", \"value\": \"patrick@star.com\", \"primary\": true } ], \"userName\": \"partickstar\", \"active\": true, \"picture\": \"\" } }, { \"method\": \"PATCH\", \"path\": \"/Users/bulkid:qwerty\", \"data\": { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp\" ], \"operations\": [ { \"op\": \"add\", \"value\": { \"displayName\": \"Paul McCartney\", \"name\": { \"givenName\": \"Paul\", \"familyName\": \"McCartney\", \"middleName\": \"\" } } } ] } } ] } If the client specifies the optional failOnErrors attribute, the request will terminate once the number of failures exceeds this value and an error code response will be returned. If the number of operations in the request exceeds the maximum, an HTTP 413 PAYLOAD TOO LARGE response code will be returned, including the maximum number of allowed operations.\nHTTP/1.1 413 PAYLOAD TOO LARGE Content-Type: application/json { \"status\": \"413\", \"detail\": \"Maximum number of operations exceeded (500)\", \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:Error\" ] } GET /scim/Groups/{id} Retrieves information about the group identified by id and returns results in application/json.\nRequires scim:read scope.\nGET /scim/Groups/c617d586-54e6-411d-8e38-64967798fa8a { \"id\": \"c617d586-54e6-411d-8e38-64967798fa8a\", \"meta\": { \"created\": \"2016-07-14T16:22:05.170+02:00\", \"lastModified\": \"2016-07-14T16:22:05.170+02:00\", \"location\": \"http://localhost:8080/scim/Groups/c617d586-54e6-411d-8e38-64967798fa8a\", \"resourceType\": \"Group\" }, \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"displayName\": \"Production\" } Warning To provide scalable management of group membership, IAM does no longer return the members claim for the SCIM Group resources, as the SCIM standard does not currently describe a way to implement pagination on group members.\nSee the members and subgroups sub-resources.\nGET /scim/Groups/{id}/members Returns a paginated list of user accounts, ordered by username, which are members of the group identified by id.

For example, the openid and profile scopes are used to obtain access to identity information about a user, but applications can define their own scopes to implement domain-specific authorization (e.g., the WLCG storage.read and storage.modify scopes are examples of domain-specific OAuth scopes).\nIAM implements two levels of access control on OAuth scopes:\na client-level vetting, implemented through the MitreID connect library, so that each registered client has a list of allowed scopes. When a client requests a scope that is not allowed to get, it gets an invalid_scope error.\nan identity-related vetting, implemented through the concept of Scope policies, that can be used to limit access to scopes based on user identity.\nThis behaviour is described in the following picture:\nScope policies Info Only admin users can delegate clients to use admin (iam:admin.read and iam:admin.write) and SCIM scopes (scim:read and scim:write). Scope policies that allow normal users to obtain access tokens with these privileged/restricted scopes will have no effect! IAM Scope policies provide a mechanism to control access to OAuth scopes. A scope policy defines:\na rule, which can be PERMIT or DENY, that determines the behaviour of the policy. PERMIT policies are used to allow access to scopes, while DENY policies are used to block access to scopes;\na scopes selector, i.e. a set of scopes for which the policy applies (and a scope matchingPolicy used to determine the scope matching algorithm used);\nan account or group selector, used to determine for which user account or group of accounts the policy should apply.\nAn example scope policy is given below:\n{ \"id\": 1, \"description\": \"Default Permit ALL policy\", \"creationTime\": \"2019-10-08T13:52:20.000+02:00\", \"lastUpdateTime\": \"2019-10-08T13:52:20.000+02:00\", \"rule\": \"PERMIT\", \"matchingPolicy\": \"EQ\", \"account\": null, \"group\": null, \"scopes\": null } The policy above is a PERMIT policy that allows access to all the scopes to any account, as clarified by the policy description.\nIn the policy, the account and group selector are not specified, which means that the policy would apply to any user account. Also the scopes selector is not specified, which means that the policy would apply to any scope.\nThe policies that are not explicitly bound to an account or a group are called default scope policies. The example policy above is enabled by the default IAM configuration, which in practice limits the default scope vetting only to the client level.\nHere’s an another example, now showing two policies:\n[{ \"id\": 4, \"description\": \"Deny access to compute.* scopes to normal users\", \"creationTime\": \"2019-12-18T15:11:04.000+01:00\", \"lastUpdateTime\": \"2019-12-18T15:11:04.000+01:00\", \"rule\": \"DENY\", \"matchingPolicy\": \"EQ\", \"account\": null, \"group\": null, \"scopes\": [ \"compute.create\", \"compute.read\", \"compute.cancel\", \"compute.modify\" ] }, { \"id\": 13, \"description\": \"Allow access to compute.* scopes to wlcg/pilot users\", \"creationTime\": \"2019-12-18T15:19:20.000+01:00\", \"lastUpdateTime\": \"2019-12-18T15:19:20.000+01:00\", \"rule\": \"PERMIT\", \"matchingPolicy\": \"EQ\", \"account\": null, \"group\": { \"uuid\": \"25084f30-1d71-4ab2-91e8-11148af16682\", \"name\": \"wlcg/pilots\", \"location\": \"https://wlcg.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/scim/Groups/25084f30-1d71-4ab2-91e8-11148af16682\" }, \"scopes\": [ \"compute.create\", \"compute.read\", \"compute.cancel\", \"compute.modify\" ] }] The first policy, as clarified in the description, would block access to the compute.create, compute.read, compute.cancel and compute.modify scopes to any authenticated user. The second policy would instead allow access to compute.* scopes only to members of the wlcg/pilot group (again, as written in the policy description).\nThe two policies can work together because the IAM policy engine evaluates the policy in a specific order: account-level policies are applied first, then group-level policies are applied and finally policies that are not bound to any specific account or group are applied. This means that a policy defined to apply at the account or group-level typically wins over a more general one, as in the example above. Also, scopes being vetted are evaluated only once across different levels. This means, for example, that a scope that was evaluated at account-level will not be re-evaluated at group-level: the decision taken for such scope is not reconsidered.\nIn more technical terms, the policy engine implements a deny-override policy composition logic, which means that a deny policy which matches a request at a given level wins over a permit policy at that same level. For example, if there are two account-level policies that would apply for scope s, one which would yield a PERMIT result, and one that would yield a DENY, the DENY will win.\nScope matching algorithms IAM currently supports three scope matching algorithms:\nEQ: which is the default, uses string equality when comparing requested scopes to scopes allowed by the client configuration or by the scope policies;\nREGEXP: which uses a regular expression evaluation when comparing requested scopes to scopes allowed by the client configuration or scope policies;\nPATH: which uses a WLCG-specific path-matching logic, described in more detail below, to compare requested scopes to scopes allowed by the client configuration or by the scope policies.\nREGEXP and PATH matching algorithms are configured by adding a scope.matchers section to the IAM configuration, as shown in the following fragment which defines the scope matching algorithm for WLCG profile scopes:\nscope: matchers: - name: storage.read type: path prefix: storage.read path: / - name: storage.create type: path prefix: storage.create path: / - name: storage.modify type: path prefix: storage.modify path: / - name: wlcg.groups type: regexp regexp: ^wlcg\\.groups(?::((?:\\/[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*)+))?$ PATH scope matching The PATH scope matching algorithm is used to implement a scope-matching logic compliant with the WLCG JWT profile rules for storage scope matching, which allow a scope to contain a parametric part describing a path. Following the Scitokens model, permissions granted on a path apply transitively to subpaths. To give an example:\nstorage.read:/cms will grant read access to the /cms directory and all its content and subdirectories, but does not grant access to the /atlas directory.\nFollowing the same logic, a client allowed to request storage.read:/example, when PATH scope matching is configured as described above for the storage.read parametric scope, will be allowed to request the storage.read:/example but also any scope containing subpaths of /example, e.g., storage.read:/example/subdir/file.\nREGEXP scope matching The REGEXP scope matching algorithms uses regular expression matching to determine whether a scope is allowed for a given client or user.\nTaking the parametric wlcg.groups scope described above:\n- name: wlcg.groups type: regexp regexp: ^wlcg\\.groups(?::((?:\\/[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*)+))?$ A client allowed to request the scope wlcg.groups will also be allowed for the scope wlcg.groups:/a/group or any other group name matching the regexp.\nThe Scope policy API The Scope Policy API is a REST API that allows to manage scope policies. Access to the API is restricted to administrator users authenticated via web interface or OAuth clients that have access to the iam:admin.read (for read access) or iam:admin.write (for write access)

Token exchange policies By default IAM comes with a permissive default token exchange policy:\n{ \"id\": 2, \"description\": \"Allow all exchanges\", \"creationTime\": \"2021-08-05T14:38:52.000+02:00\", \"lastUpdateTime\": \"2021-08-05T14:38:52.000+02:00\", \"rule\": \"PERMIT\", \"originClient\": { \"type\": \"ANY\" }, \"destinationClient\": { \"type\": \"ANY\" } } The policy above will allow exchanges among all clients that have the token exchange grant type enabled.\nAs can be seen by the above example a token exchange policy specifies:\na rule, which can be PERMIT or DENY, which determines the policy behaviour an origin client selector: this selector will match the client linked to the access token presented during the token exchange; in this case, the selector will match ANY client. a destination client selector: this selector will match the destination client, i.e. the client requesting the token exchange; in this case, the selector will match ANY client. The policy above does not specify any scope policy, which basically means that all scopes allowed by the origin and destination client configurations could be exchanged among the clients.\nLet’s see a policy which limits the scopes exchanged:\n{ \"id\": 3, \"description\": \"Allow exchanges for openid and offline_access scopes for client token-exchange-actor\", \"creationTime\": \"2021-08-05T14:46:58.000+02:00\", \"lastUpdateTime\": \"2021-08-05T14:46:58.000+02:00\", \"rule\": \"PERMIT\", \"originClient\": { \"type\": \"ANY\" }, \"destinationClient\": { \"type\": \"BY_ID\", \"matchParam\": \"token-exchange-actor\" }, \"scopePolicies\": [ { \"rule\": \"PERMIT\", \"type\": \"EQ\", \"matchParam\": \"openid\" }, { \"rule\": \"PERMIT\", \"type\": \"EQ\", \"matchParam\": \"offline_access\" } ] } The policy above allows all exchanges for the scopes openid and offline_access between any origin client and the token-exchange-actor client. We see a new type of client selector, which is used to target the policy to a specific client selected by clientId.\nWe see that the policy provides a list of scope policies, which allow exchange only for the openid and offline_access scopes.\nClient selectors IAM currently supports three client selector types:\nANY: which will match any client BY_SCOPE: which will match any client that is authorized to request a scope passed as a parameter BY_ID: which will a client by clientId ... \"originClient\": { \"type\": \"BY_ID\", \"matchParam\": \"origin-client\" }, \"destinationClient\": { \"type\": \"BY_SCOPE\", \"matchParam\": \"storage.write:/\" }, ... For example, the policy fragment above would apply to any token exchange started by a client allowed to request the storage.write:/ scope when exchanging a token issued to origin-client.\nToken exchange scope policies Token exchange scope policies (not to be confused with Scope policies) define which scopes are authorized or blocked in a token exchange policy. When scope policies are not defined in an exchange policy, the meaning is that all scopes allowed by the origin and destination client configurations are allowed for an exchange.\nA scope policy defines:\na rule, which can be PERMIT or DENY a type, where allowed values are EQ, REGEXP, PATH which identifies the matching algorithm used to match the exchanged scope a matchParam, which specifies the scope to be matched For example:\n\"scopePolicies\": [ { \"rule\": \"PERMIT\", \"type\": \"REGEXP\", \"matchParam\": \"compute.*\" }, { \"rule\": \"DENY\", \"type\": \"REGEXP\", \"matchParam\": \"storage.*\" } ] The two scope policies above combined will allow any exchange of scopes that would match the regular expression compute.* and will block exchanges of scopes matching regular expression storage.*. Important scope policy evaulation rules:\nToken exchange scope policies are applied to all the scopes requested in a token exchange, i.e. a policy allowing each requested scope must be present for the token exchange to succeed.\nWhen multiple scope policies apply to a given scope, DENY policies win.\nWhen scope policies are defined, a PERMIT policy should always be included, otherwise any exchange would be blocked. If that is the intended behaviour, simply use a DENY token exchange policy.\nWhen a requested scope is not authorized, either due to a DENY scope policy or a missing PERMIT policy, the exchange fails with an invalid_scope error.\nDefining scope policies in a DENY token exchange policy is redundant (the evaluation would block at client level) and would not make sense.\nToken exchange policy ranking The engine that evaluates token exchange policies implements a policy ranking algorithm to determine which policy should be applied for an exchange. As with scope policies, the ranking algorithm is based on how specific the policies are for the input origin and destination clients in a token exchange.\nAs we have seen, origin and destination clients can be matched in three ways:\nusing the ANY selector, i.e. matching any client using the BY_SCOPE selector, i.e., matching any client that can request a given scope using the BY_ID selector, i.e. matching clients by clientId We link a rank, which is an integer value, to each of the selector to represent the selector specificity. The rank of the selectors are given in the following table:\nClient selector Rank ANY 0 BY_SCOPE 1 BY_ID 2 The rank of a policy P is computed as the sum of rank of the origin and destination client selectors:\nrank(P) = rank(origin) + rank(destination) At the same rank, DENY policies will win. Let’s assume we have two exchange policies defined:\n[ { \"id\": 2, \"description\": \"All all exchanges just for the openid scope\", \"creationTime\": \"2021-08-05T14:38:52.000+02:00\", \"lastUpdateTime\": \"2021-08-05T14:38:52.000+02:00\", \"rule\": \"PERMIT\", \"originClient\": { \"type\": \"ANY\" }, \"destinationClient\": { \"type\": \"ANY\" }, \"scopePolicies\": [ { \"rule\": \"PERMIT\", \"type\": \"EQ\", \"matchParam\": \"openid\" } ] }, { \"id\": 3, \"description\": \"Allow any exchange among clients A and B\", \"creationTime\": \"2021-08-05T14:38:52.000+02:00\", \"lastUpdateTime\": \"2021-08-05T14:38:52.000+02:00\", \"rule\": \"PERMIT\", \"originClient\": { \"type\": \"BY_ID\", \"matchParam\": \"A\" }, \"destinationClient\": { \"type\": \"BY_ID\", \"matchParam\": \"B\" } } ] Also let’s assume client B requests a token exchange for scopes openid storage.read:/ presenting an access token issued to client A.\nIAM would cycle through the exchange policies and select the ones that would apply to the exchange, in this case both policy 2 and 3.\nThen IAM would rank the policy according to the specificity of the client selectors, which would be\nrank(p_2)=0 rank(p_3)=4 so policy 3 would be selected, which would allow the exchange.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"The Token exchange policy API allows to define fine-grained policies …","ref":"/v/v1.12.0/docs/reference/api/token-exchange-policy-api/","tags":"","title":"Token exchange policy API"}]
